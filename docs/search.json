    "section": "1.3 Why learn R?",
    "text": "1.3 Why learn R?\n1. R is a free and open-source software package.\n2. R is a powerful software for data analysis and statistical computing.\nFollowing are some steps that need to perform for your data analysis projects.\n\nImport/ Export data\nData cleaning\nData visualisation\nData modelling\nModel deployment\nEnsuring validity and interpretability of models\nPresentation and communication of results\n\nAdditionally, ensuring the reproducibility of data analysis and modeling workflows is crucial for enhancing trustworthiness. R has packages to fulfill all these data analysis and modeling needs.\n3. R can be utilized for tasks beyond traditional data analysis, modelling and statistical computing\n\nScientific Writing Tools: R can be used for scientific writing, particularly through the use of packages like knitr rmarkdown, and Quarto. These packages allow you to integrate R code directly into documents alongside text and figures, which is highly useful for reproducible research and automated report generation. These are useful for thesis writing, book writing or any other documentation work. This book “Programming and Data Analysis with R” is written based on Quarto.\nWebsite Development: R can be used developed websites, particularly through the use of packages like knitr rmarkdown, blogdown and Quarto. For example, the website https://hellor.netlify.app/ is written based on blogdown and https://thiyangt.github.io/rprogramming/ is written based on quarto.\nCreating Presentations: R can generate dynamic and visually appealing presentations using rmarkdown, xaringan, quarto, etc. These packages enable you to embed R code, plots, and interactive elements directly into presentation slides. Here is an example presentation developed using xaringan https://thiyangt.github.io/whyR2021keynote/#1\nCreating Posters: R can be utilized to design scientific posters using packages such as posterdown. These packages provide templates for creating professional-looking posters directly from R Markdown documents. You can include plots, tables, formatted text and graphics in your poster design.\nWeb Application Development: This capability is particularly useful for developing data-driven tools, simulations, and dashboards that can be accessed through web browsers without the need for users to install additional software.\n\n4. There is a large community of users.\nLearning a programming language with a large community of users is particularly important for several reasons:\n\nSupport and Resources to learn: This means there are abundant resources available online, including tutorials, documentation, forums, and open-source libraries. When you encounter issues or need guidance, you’re more likely to find solutions quickly due to the active community.\nRegular updates and improvements: Popular languages receive regular updates and improvements driven by community feedback and contributions.\nCollaboration and Career opportunities: Since, there are many users you are very likely to find good job opportunities and colloboration opportunities.\nNetworking: Being part of a large programming community allows you to participate in hackathons, and attend meetups or conferences. One such a R community is “R Ladies”.",

    "text": "1.4 R and RStudio\nWhat is the difference between R and RStudio? R is the programming language that provides the statistical computing capabilities. R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) for R. Dr Julia Lowndes illustrates the distinctions between R and RStudio using the analogy as follows:\n\n“If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.”\n\n\nJulie Lowndes (https://jules32.github.io/2016-07-12-Oxford/R_RStudio/, accessed on May 1, 2024)",

Make sure that you are downloading the appropriate version that matches your computer’s operating system. From the same link you can also download the R. Furthermore, RStudio requires a specific version of R. For example “RStudio requires R 3.3.0+”. Make sure you have the correct R version. The version of the R programming language is denoted using a format like “x.x.x”, where each “x” represents a number indicating the major version, minor version, and patch level respectively.",
