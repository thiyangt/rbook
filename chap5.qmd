# Logical Operators in R

Logical operators are used to compare values and return TRUE or FALSE. They are very useful in conditions, filtering, and control flow. 

## List of commonly used logical operators in R.

`==` : equal to

`!=` : not equal to

`>` : greater than

`<` : less than

`<=` : less than or equal to

`>=` : greater than or equal to

`|` : OR (at least one condition must be TRUE)

`&` : AND (both conditions must be TRUE)

**Examples**



```{r, comment=NA}
c(1, 2, 3) != c(10, 20, 3)
```

```{r, comment=NA}
1:5 > 3
```

```{r, comment=NA}
1:5 < 3
```


## Membership Operator: %in%

The `%in%` operator is used to check whether elements of one vector are present in another vector.

Returns a logical vector (TRUE or FALSE) of the same length as the first input.

**Example**

x <- 1:10
y <- 1:3
x %in% y    # Is each element of x in y?
y %in% x    # Is each element of y in x?
